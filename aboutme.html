                    Hello! My name is Sophia Bersani and I am currently a senior in college attending Syracuse University. I have always been passionate about living a healthy lifestyle and nourishing my body with healthy foods and exercise. I love adventures and particularly exploring the outdoors. I would also definitely consider myself a “foodie” and I love treating myself on occasions to delicious restaurants. I recently began learning to cook and have developed a passion for creating my own recipes as well as discovering amazing restaurants in some of my favorite cities. This is why I decided to create Healthful Cravings! In my website you will find heathy recipes along with my top restaurant recommendations in the three cities I know best, New York City, Boston, & Syracuse! I currently live in Syracuse, NY and I am planning on moving to NYC August 2021.  I hope you enjoy my content. Please feel free to contact me by email with any inquiries.
