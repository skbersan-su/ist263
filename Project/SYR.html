            <h2><i>Top 5 Restaurants</i></h2>

            <p><strong>1. Core</strong></p>
            <p>The best and most convenient salad spot! Create your own salad from the many, many options they offer and quickly get on your way if you are in a rush. I love heading here if I don’t have enough time to cook for dinner or if I am just passing by on my way home. Great fast and healthy option. </p>

            <p><strong>2. Blue Monkey</strong></p>
            <p>One of my favorite restaurants right on Marshall St. It’s a great campus option for sushi, poke bowls, or even teriyaki chicken. They have easy pickup for a great option to eat between classes. My personal favorite is their Poke bowls with the yummy poke sauce on top.  </p>
            
            <p><strong>3. The York</strong></p>
            <p>My favorite restaurant in upstate New York by far. This upscale restaurant is the perfect place for birthdays, night’s out, and any other occasion. All of the food on their menu is wonderful and I would highly recommend their margaritas. I love sharing different plates with whoever I go with so I can try more than just one dish!</p>
           
            <p><strong>4. Francescas</strong></p>
            <p>The best Italian restaurant in Syracuse in my opinion. Their pink sauce is homemade and delicious, pairing it with rigatoni and chicken is the perfect combo. Each meal comes with a house salad and I definitely recommend ordering burrata as an appetizer. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>5. Rise n Shine Diner</strong></p>
            <p>AMAZING breakfast located right off Syracuse campus on Wescott street. Everything on their menu is over the top and amazing. Not the healthiest option but for sure delicious!</p>
