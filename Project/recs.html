            <p>On this page you will find a few of my favorite restaurants in each of my cities! I originally grew up in Boston, MA, I then lived in Syracuse, NY for 4 years throughout college, and have constantly visited NYC throughout my life and I am moving there in August 2021 to begin my post-graduation job! These are just a few places that I love, and I hope you do too.
