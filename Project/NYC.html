            <h2><i>Top 5 Restaurants</i></h2>

            <p><strong>1. The Catch</strong></p>
            <!-- learn how to insert video -->
            <p>This upscale restaurant is the perfect romantic dinner, girl’s night out, or anytime you are looking for fine dining. It offers a variety of menu options from sushi, to lobster, filet, and more. Not to mention their amazing cocktails and famous “Hit Me” chocolate lava cake. This restaurant also serves an amazing environment, rooftop seating, and excellent service. </p>

            <p><strong>2. Sadelle's</strong></p>
            <p>My all-time favorite brunch spot! Homemade bagels, fresh cut lox, and endless mimosas, what more could you want? Famous for their lox tower, the eggs and homefries should not be slept on. All of the options are their menu are very delicious. This trendy restaurant is perfect for fun weekend with friends! </p>

            <p><strong>3. Cacio e Pepe</strong></p>
            <p>This is the perfect spot for pasta lovers. Known for their famous cheesy pasta wheel, their signature dish is definitely my favorite. Homemade fresh pasta spun in parmesan, mouthwatering. Make sure to get their early or make a reservation because this hot restaurant fills up fast!</p>

            <p><strong>4. Joe's Shanghai</strong></p>
            <p>Located right in the heart of Chinatown this authentic Chinese restaurant is famous for their delectable soup dumplings. This is a really fun place to go with friends and even late night, as china town is always buzzing!</p>

            <p><strong>5. Just Salad</strong></p>
            <p>The best healthy lunch spot! Super great place to grab a quick bite during work and they even offer special deals if you sign up for their monthly membership! I found it really fun to get creative with my salad orders and try something new each time because they offer so many different choices. </p>
