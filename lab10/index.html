    Hello! My name is Sophia Bersani and I am a senior at Syracuse University. I am majoring in Information Management & Technology with a concentration in Digital Retail and a minor in Psychology. I recently accepted a job in NYC that will begin after I graduate in May 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have a lot of interests including fashion, fitness, and travelling with one of my favorites being <strong> technology! </strong> I love exploring all of the various aspects of technology and using my creativity and innovation to solve challenges. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I consider myself to be very friendly, motivated, and curious. I am also very passionate about the environment and my dream is to one day work as a technology analyst for a company that advocates to create a more sustainable environment and help save the planet such as Patagonia or National Geographic.
    </p>
