            <p><strong>1. By Chloe </strong></p>
            <p>This healthy grab n go restaurant is entirely vegan and offers amazing options for everyone! Their sweet potato fries and black bean burger are my personal favorites, but everything on the menu is good! There are multiple locations around Boston so it’s easy to stop by no matter where you are. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>2. Trattoria il Panino</strong></p>
            <p>Located in the heart of the North End, Boston’s famous Italian area, this restaurant has endless pasta, pizza, and seafood options. My personal favorite dish is Paccheri ai Frutti di Mare consists of homemade Napoleon pasta with assorted fresh shellfish. A great lunch or dinner spot. </p>

            <p><strong>3. Life Alive</strong></p>
            <p>Another vegan restaurant, the menu at this restaurant is filled with so many delicious options. Sandwiches, smoothies, salads, and more it is the perfect spot to quickly grab a bite or use their comfy environment to sit, relax, and do some work.</p>
           
            <p><strong>4. Union Oyster House</strong></p>
            <p>Located right next to Faneuil hall, this is America’s oldest continuously operating restaurant. It serves amazing seafood, great bear, and a fun environment. Head over the Mike’s Pastry on Hanover street after for a delicious Cannoli, the best dessert!</p>>
            
            <p><strong>5. Lincoln Tavern</strong></p>
            <p>Super fun restaurant amazing for brunch, lunch, or dinner! Located in Southie, a super hip and trendy area this restaurant offers so many delicious food options as well as fun events such as pumpkin carving and painting. This is my favorite spot in Boston for brunch, I love their avocado toast and fruit filled French toast. </p>

                <p><strong>1. The Catch</strong></p>
                <!-- learn how to insert video -->
                <p>This upscale restaurant is the perfect romantic dinner, girl’s night out, or anytime you are looking for fine dining. It offers a variety of menu options from sushi, to lobster, filet, and more. Not to mention their amazing cocktails and famous “Hit Me” chocolate lava cake. This restaurant also serves an amazing environment, rooftop seating, and excellent service. </p>
    
                <p><strong>2. Sadelle's</strong></p>
                <p>My all-time favorite brunch spot! Homemade bagels, fresh cut lox, and endless mimosas, what more could you want? Famous for their lox tower, the eggs and homefries should not be slept on. All of the options are their menu are very delicious. This trendy restaurant is perfect for fun weekend with friends! </p>
    
                <p><strong>3. Cacio e Pepe</strong></p>
                <p>This is the perfect spot for pasta lovers. Known for their famous cheesy pasta wheel, their signature dish is definitely my favorite. Homemade fresh pasta spun in parmesan, mouthwatering. Make sure to get their early or make a reservation because this hot restaurant fills up fast!</p>
    
                <p><strong>4. Joe's Shanghai</strong></p>
                <p>Located right in the heart of Chinatown this authentic Chinese restaurant is famous for their delectable soup dumplings. This is a really fun place to go with friends and even late night, as china town is always buzzing!</p>
    
                <p><strong>5. Just Salad</strong></p>
                <p>The best healthy lunch spot! Super great place to grab a quick bite during work and they even offer special deals if you sign up for their monthly membership! I found it really fun to get creative with my salad orders and try something new each time because they offer so many different choices. </p>

           <div class="SYR">
            <p id="SYR"><strong>Syracuse Restaurant Recommendations</strong></p> <br>
    
                <p><strong>1. Core</strong></p>
                <p>The best and most convenient salad spot! Create your own salad from the many, many options they offer and quickly get on your way if you are in a rush. I love heading here if I don’t have enough time to cook for dinner or if I am just passing by on my way home. Great fast and healthy option. </p>
    
                <p><strong>2. Blue Monkey</strong></p>
                <p>One of my favorite restaurants right on Marshall St. It’s a great campus option for sushi, poke bowls, or even teriyaki chicken. They have easy pickup for a great option to eat between classes. My personal favorite is their Poke bowls with the yummy poke sauce on top.  </p>
                
                <p><strong>3. The York</strong></p>
                <p>My favorite restaurant in upstate New York by far. This upscale restaurant is the perfect place for birthdays, night’s out, and any other occasion. All of the food on their menu is wonderful and I would highly recommend their margaritas. I love sharing different plates with whoever I go with so I can try more than just one dish!</p>
               
                <p><strong>4. Francescas</strong></p>
                <p>The best Italian restaurant in Syracuse in my opinion. Their pink sauce is homemade and delicious, pairing it with rigatoni and chicken is the perfect combo. Each meal comes with a house salad and I definitely recommend ordering burrata as an appetizer. 
                </p>
    
                <p><strong>5. Rise n Shine Diner</strong></p>
                <p>AMAZING breakfast located right off Syracuse campus on Wescott street. Everything on their menu is over the top and amazing. Not the healthiest option but for sure delicious!</p>
